# MediaManager-FrontEnd
The frontend for a social media managing website

I only actually worked on this project for about two weeks before getting overwhelmed with college work, although I still think it's a pretty cool idea so I might come back to it in the future :)

Until then it's basically just a basic nextjs project template.
